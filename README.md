# WebcamSlidesUtility
This is a small browser based utility to allow you to have your webcam up while presenting a Google Slides deck. To use this, you muse first publish your Google Slides deck and use the provided link.

Edit: There is a Beta Zoom feature that allows you to do something similar to this with virtual backgrounds. I recommend that if you're using Zoom.
